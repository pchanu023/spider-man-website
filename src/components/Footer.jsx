                Stan Lee conceived Spider-Man as a unique superhero inspired by seeing a spider crawl up a wall. He wanted a relatable hero who dealt with ordinary problems like money, school, and relationships while also fighting crime. Initially, the idea was rejected by publishers, who thought spiders were unappealing. However, Lee included Spider-Man in the final issue of Amazing Fantasy, which became an unexpected hit. This success led to the launch of <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> comic series, cementing Spider-Man as one of Marvelâ€™s most iconic and beloved superheroes.
