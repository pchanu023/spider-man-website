                Peter is an orphan raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in Queens, New York. A brilliant but socially awkward teenager, his life changes forever when he is bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him extraordinary abilities, including super strength, agility, wall-crawling, and "Spider-Sense."
                Initially, Peter uses his powers for personal gain, but after letting a thief escape, the same criminal later kills Uncle Ben. This tragedy teaches Peter a profound lesson: "With great power comes great responsibility." Determined to honor his uncleâ€™s memory, Peter becomes Spider-Man, using his abilities to fight crime and protect others. <br />
                While fighting villains such as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, Peter also juggles the struggles of daily life, including school, work as a freelance photographer, and his relationships with friends and loved ones.
